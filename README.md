# Project: Data Analyst Jobs Analysis

# Introduction
Hey there! This is my first SQL project that is entirely based on the SQL course offered by no other than "Luke Barousse" and "Kelly Adams". Dive into the job market focused on Data Analyst roles! This project is best for people who want to explore different career opportunities or for people who are aiming to identify high-potential business startups. This helped me focus on what I should prioritize in order to be a successful Data Analyst.

# Background
This project explores the top-paying Data Science job postings in the marketplace for 2023. The inspiration for this project stems from my keen interest in learning SQL and identifying my ideal career path in the future. Specifically, I will explore Data Analyst job postings to determine the essential skills required for this role.

The project will primarily focus on commonly used skills, in-demand skills, top-paying skills, and the most optimal skills in the Data Analyst field. Additionally, I will analyze whether remote work is more advantageous than non-remote work.

There are four(4) tables in this dataset: **job_postings_fact table**, **company_dim table**, **skills_job_dim table**, and **skills_dim table**
